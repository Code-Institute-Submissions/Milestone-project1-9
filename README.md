# UX
## Ideal User
### Users visiting my website would be:

*   From anyone in the Netherland
*   A food lover
*   Anyone who wants to get catering service for any event.
*   English speaking

### Why this website is a great solution:
In the Netherlands, there are very few good catering services for indian cuisine along with other cuisine so this website will fulfill a great variety of peoples food demand. In this current locked down situation , home delivery of good food is very demandable for a lot of people.

# Design Choices
## Overall Inspiration:
[This blog post](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/best-website-designs-list) inspired a number of my style choices while creating the website.

# Features
## Existing Features
### 1.  Home Page

* Upon arrival to the website the user is greeted with a [hero image](assets/images/indexpage.PNG) of prepring food with a message which gives the idea of the website at a first glance .
* Along with the image, the vibrant color of the page and the logo at the right side of the nav bar is really eyecatching. 
* At the left side there is a button for [request qoute](assets/images/indexpage.PNG) so that user can request for their desired food or catering service very easily.
* There are 2 [customer reviews](assets/images/index2.PNG) below for the new user.
* After that the [feature](assets/images/index2.PNG) of Authnic is added where new feature catering service is highlighted so that user can easily understand that this is the latest addition.

### 2.  About Section

[This section](assets/images/aboutsec.PNG) starts with another hero image showing some of the chefs working together so that user can understand about the chefs, cooks and cooking environment, provides information of the website owner's goal.
